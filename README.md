# IVR-Assignment

The main code to be executed for the assignment are located in files image1.py, image2.py and target_move.py.

image2.py has to be run first with the rosrun command because it creates topics which are later subscribed in image1.py. 

Both image1.py and image2.py have to be run from src directory and they have to load templates which are acquired with os.getcmd() path

Due to the nature of our code development, the other files were create in the process and I decided to keep them to show the history of development
